About Me
========

I'm a self-taught developer. It was all started in 2017, when I decided my life
is so boring and I needed to change something in it. Learning how to talk with
a computer is one of the best experience, it brings me a lot of emotions.

I never forget my first program, which is asking user to input an integer
number and then counting down to 0 (pretty silly, huh?). But with that silly
program, I had a sleepless night, thinking about all things I can archive in
the world (Again, pretty silly, huh?). And that was the first time I took
coding as my hobby.

I was so in love with [Python](https://www.python.org/) until I think [C# and
.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) is better for developers, it may takes
longer to create a program, but much less pain when maintaining ones.

Up to now...
